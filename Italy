Tips for euro trip 

* Phone plan - buy a 4GB-12GB plan depending on your use. I’ve used 5GB after turning on cell data for some apps 
  like photos, etc., photos can be synced from WiFi later. 12GB plan that I bought was from three(3) UK company. 
  Bought it from amazon US for $19. Covers 71 countries with unlimited call/text + 12GB data! I activated 2 days 
  before the trip.
* Compare train prices of all the places you want to go with a rough plan and check if Eurail pass would save 
  you money. There are number of Eurail pass you can choose - Count the number of traveling days. 
  The prices keep changing all the time to book tickets. If you are traveling to Italy or France you might have
  to pay a 10 euro to reserve seat. Use rail planner app to see which trains needs a seat reservation. 
   Note : all fast trains needs a reservation.
* If eurail doesn’t save money, but it’s only $100 more when compared, I’d strongly suggest getting one if you 
  don’t want plan things ahead!
* For my itinerary- if I had booked everything in advance I’d have paid $1024! 2^10. But we ended paying $868. 
  Well we also ended up going to different places which we didn’t plan initially. (1024 includes that). Could have 
  saved a bit more if I had changed my plan a bit more!
*  Places we visited - Zurich, Lucerne, zug, Milan, Rome, Naples, amalfi coast, Pompeii, Florence, Venice, milan(again), 
   como, Geneva, Paris 
* All of our hotels were 3-4 star rated and near (~10 min walk) central/main station.
* Try reading about the place/art or pick up a book if you don’t want to spend on guide!
* If you don’t want tap water - buy it from supermarket 6 (1.5L or 2L) pack is roughly €2-3. Fill it in your bottles 
  and carry everywhere!
* Have some snacks in backpack. 
* If you wanna dine at restaurants and don’t wanna pay cover or for water get a To go! €4-5 cheaper per head. Honestly o
  nce in a while it’s nice to have food at restaurants but it takes too much time. Our food schedule was breakfast at 
  hotel around 8-9, mini snack or light meal around 1-2 good dinner at 6-7. In bed by 9-10. Winter time we had to get up 
  early for sun.
* If you don’t get breakfast or if it’s like €10 more at hotel don’t sweat! buy stuff from super market(instant coffee, 
  milk, cornflakes/bread). Also if you are taking train you can carry most of them to another city! Most of the hotels 
  don’t have coffee maker/kettle. Some hotels rent kettles. Some places you can ask for hot water for your coffee(assuming 
  you drink black). No microwaves even at 3-4star hotels. But you don’t need them. Coffee is typically €1.20-1.50 in 
  Italy and cappuccino is €1.70-2.00.
* Carry some dehydrated food like Upma etc for a quick meal or bread sandwich.
* Milan buy a day pass €7
    * Spent 1 day
    * Visited Duomo with skip the line pass
    * Last supper visited with a guide (it was worth it but not mandatory). 
* Rome buy omnia pass €113 or at least a Roma pass ~€40.  Make a note of the pickup point if you buy online. You can jump 
  into the hop on and hop off bus to pick up tickets - bus name Vatican City and Rome (yellow color)
    * Spent 2.75 days
    * Roma pass gives access to public transport for 72 hours plus access to coliseum, Roma forum and palatine hill with 
      skip the line (you need at least 5hrs to visit this) + one other museum.
    * Omnia pass gives access to hop on and hop off service + Vatican city(st Peters basilica, Vatican museum+ Sistine chapel)
    * Day 1 - St. John at the lantern, museo capitoloni
    * Day 2 Vatican City, piazza novona, pantheon
    * Day 3 coliseum, Roma forum, palatine hill, piazza del populo, piazza do spagna, Fontana di trevi
* Naples
    * One day to amalfi - take circumvesuvia train to sorrento and then Sita bus to amalfi ~€20   per head round trip 
      (2.5 hrs from Naples centrale) We had a hard time during 25th dec. we had to take cab (shared with 2 other 
      couples) + rented a Vespa. (€50 but awesome experience). No trains and buses on 25th dec
    * One day to Pompeii - take circumvesuviana train ~ 40 mins from centrale. €12 ticket price for 2 round trip! Make 
      sure you validate your tickets! Pompeii is huge either get a tour guide or follow 2-4hrs tour on a book. 
      Dec 24th and 26th is free. Closed on Jan 1, may 1 and dec 25. Once you exit take a bus (near train station) to 
      mt Vesuvius. In winter last hike to the top ends at 3pm(~2km round trip). The bus is a good 45 min ride one way.
    * Have a pizza from la antica de michele (cash only)
* Florence
    * Day 1 local attractions
    * Day 2 uffizi gallery + few attractions near by
    * Day 3 pizza making course by walkabout company. Expensive but highly recommend!
* Venice
    * Bought a San Marco pass at the station + 2 day boat pass
    * Day 1: doges palace + st Marco square walked all the way there
    * Day 2: murano, burano,lido. New year night celebrations
    * Day 3: took it easy with couple of museums.
* Milan
    * Took train to como. You can spend a good 2-3 hrs there. Take a ferry ride. Free trip with eu rail pass. 
    * This is where e we messed up the plan. We could have gone to interlaken that night instead of staying in Milan! 
      Could have spent half day there and then could have taken a train to Geneva and Paris that day.
